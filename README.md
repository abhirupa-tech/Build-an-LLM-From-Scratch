# Build-an-LLM-From-Scratch
A Learn-Along Style Repo to Help you Build your Very First LLM, train and test it

<h2>Steps to Building our Very First LKLM From Scratch :slightly_smiling_face: </h2>
<p>This is a follow along style Github Repository. The aim of the Project is to enhance my own learning and help others learn too. Feel free to send in Pull Requests to make this Project even more better</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Define a Purpose:</b> What do you want your LLM to do? Should it be a chatbot or be an area expert. According to your purpose you would have to pick your corpora/ dataset</li>
  <li><b>Gather and Clean Data:</b> Get your corpu and clean all data anomalies</li>
  <li><b>Build your Model:</b> Pick a mode RNN/ transformer etc and choose how you would be building your LLM ie how many neurons in each layers and what do you want the layers to look like</li>
  <li><b>Analyze and Test:</b> Test based on Metrics such as Perplexity (how accurately does model predict the next word in a sentence) and accuracy (how correct the model's answer is)</li>
</ul>
